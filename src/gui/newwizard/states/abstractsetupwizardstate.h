 * To improve the code structure and increase the readability, we use the state pattern to organize the different wizard states.

 * creating a new state object. The state object initializes itself from the data available in the account builder.
 *
 * This base class further implements a variant of the abstract factory pattern (pages are created by the constructors and can be
