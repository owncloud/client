    // and let the main controller create it/pass it so it has direct access to the results. We should not use the main
    // controller model imo since we don't want to accept the values until all have been successfully obtained.
    // a dedicated model will also make testing easier. this is tbd once we have some basic functional impl for the wizard
    // and first page.
