Feature: Project spaces
    As a user
    I want to sync project space
    So that I can do view and manage the space

        Given the administrator has created a folder "planning" in space "Project101"
        And the administrator has uploaded a file "testfile.txt" with content "some content" inside space "Project101"
        And the administrator has added user "Alice" to space "Project101" with role "viewer"
        And user "Alice" has set up a client with default settings
        Then user "Alice" should be able to open the file "testfile.txt" on the file system
        And as "Alice" the file "testfile.txt" should have content "some content" on the file system

    @skipOnWindows
    Scenario: User with Viewer role cannot edit the file (Linux only)

        And the administrator has added user "Alice" to space "Project101" with role "viewer"
