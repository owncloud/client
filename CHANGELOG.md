## Details

* Bugfix - Fix location loading on Mac: [#6761](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/6761)

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/6761

* Bugfix - Schedule syncs after an abort: [#11396](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11396)

   We fixed a bug where the client stopped scheduling syncs after a sync was
   aborted.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11396

* Bugfix - Fix description of manage public links action: [#11450](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11450)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11450

* Bugfix - Fix early-use crash in the folder watcher on Linux: [#11460](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11460)

   In a few error scenarios, the folder watcher on Linux shows a dialog with an
   error message. A crash has been fixed where this occurred before the GUI was
   fully initialised.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11460
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11475

* Bugfix - Properly encode scope and prompt items in OAuth URL: [#11472](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11472)

   Fixed a bug where the scope and prompt items of an OAuth query would not be
   encoded, resulting in an invalid request.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11472
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11479

* Bugfix - Client stuck in reconnecting state after application start: [#11478](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11478)

   We fixed a bug where the client was starting OAuth authentication but did not
   prompt the user properly to renew authentication. This resulted in the client
   apparently getting stuck in the "reconnecting" state.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11478

* Bugfix - Strip user information from new-connection URL: [#11497](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11497)

   Credentials in the URL are not supported for some time. This fix strips them
   from the URL before storage and using it to authenticate the client to the
   server.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11497
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11509

* Bugfix - Support logging redirect: [#11581](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11581)

   We now log when all urls when a request was redirected.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11581

* Bugfix - Don't store null certificates in the account: [#11621](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11621)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11621

* Bugfix - Fix crash for folders that could not be initialized: [#11664](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11664)

   We fixed a bug where interacting with a folder in the file browser could lead to
   a crash if the folder was not properly initialized.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11664

* Bugfix - Make open account in browser accessible for keyboard navigation: [#11772](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11772)

   On the account settings page, the status label contained the URL of the server.
   This URL was not accessible with keyboard navigation or when a screen-reader was
   used. Now there is an "Open in Web Browser" action in the pop-up menu of the
   "Manage Account" button (which is next to the status label), and the URL has
   been removed from the status label.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11772
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11800
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11810

* Bugfix - Don't log misleading error if dynamic registration failed: [#11839](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11839)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11839

* Bugfix - Fix crash after resource job fails: [#12045](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12045)

   When a network error occurs while fetching a resource (e.g. a space image), no
   icon is available, and a crash would occur. This is fixed by returning an empty
   icon.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12045

* Change - Revert local folder name back to pre 3.0 behavior: [#6390](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/6390)

   Due to user requests, we reverted the folder name from

   ```
   ownCloud - Albert@owncloud.com
   ownCloud - Katherine@owncloud.org
   ownCloud - Marie@owncloud.com
   ```

   Back to

   ```
   ownCloud
   ownCloud (1)
   ownCloud (2)
   ```

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/6390

* Change - Make messages translatable that occur early in start-up: [#11142](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11142)

   These messages include the command-line messages (both errors and the help
   text). To do this, the deprecated `--confdir` option has been removed. This
   option was only used on windows before roaming profiles were supported.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11142
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11246
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11300

* Change - Remove unused command line option --language: [#11245](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11245)

   This option was used before the UI language could be chosen in the settings. The
   option --list-languages is also removed, as it no longer serves a purpose.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11245
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11270

* Change - Windows: always use fusion style: [#11275](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11275)

   We already used the fusion style on Windows for years if the system used dpi
   scaling. Since Qt6.5 the fusion style also support the dark theme on Windows.
   Those two reasons convinced us that always using the fusion style on Windows
   will result in the best experience for the users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11275

* Change - Deprecate suffix VFS: [#11325](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11325)

   We decided to deprecate the suffix VFS implementations and thus prepare its
   removal in 7.0.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11325

* Change - Removal of selective sync tree from account status page: [#11357](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11357)

   We removed the selective sync support from the main widget and moved it to its
   own dialog, available through the context menu of the sync folder.

   Having both the sync status and the selective sync settings in the same widget
   caused a lot of problems and overhead over the years. Additionally, it required
   us to maintain a lot of special and basically duplicated code, as we already had
   a dedicated widget to handle selective sync.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11357
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11357
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8102
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/5423
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/4080
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11524

* Change - Fix three badly styled warning messages: [#11412](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11412)

   There were 3 labels for warning messages that were nearly unreadable in dark
   mode due to bad styling. These have been changed to only use a bold font, but
   are now displayed with a big warning icon on their left. The places are: the
   account settings page, the folder wizard remote path page, and the log browser.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11412
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11470

* Change - Removed support for limiting sync of big new folder & external storage: [#11517](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11517)

   We removed an option which allowed to block new folders bigger than a set limit,
   from being synchronized automatically, when selective synchronization is used.
   Additionally, we removed the option that allowed to block automatic
   synchronization of external storage.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11517

* Change - Set the 'No' button as default action in the Unknown Certificate dialog: [#11531](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11531)

   When an unknown certificate is used by the server, the safe action is to reject
   this certificate. So the default action for this dialog should be not to accept
   this unknown certificate.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11531

* Change - Remove `Remove all files` dialog: [#11569](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11569)

   We no longer ask the user whether all files should be removed but just sync.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11569
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7304

* Change - Rewrite of the spaces browser: [#11595](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11595)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11595

* Change - New update channel for ownCloud infinite scale: [#11742](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11742)

   The release series 6 is a long term release. As version 7 will drop the support
   for ownCloud 10, users will either have to select the ownCloud infinite scale
   update channel in the about-dialog or manually install a newer release. This
   change only affects the unbranded version.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11742

* Change - Remove support for branded shell extensions on Linux: [#11743](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11743)

   From now on user will have to install dolphin-owncloud nautilus-owncloud instead
   of a branded version.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11743

* Change - Only allow to add un-synced spaces: [#11752](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11752)

   We now prevent users from syncing the same space multiple times.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11752
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11759

* Change - Rewrite of the login widget in QML: [#11856](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11856)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11856

* Change - Only support APFS on macOS: [#12044](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12044)

   Apple File System in contrary to HFS+ is Unicode normalization preserving. To
   support this properly the upcoming version 6 of desktop client will support NFC
   and NFD encoding on all client platforms based on the individual
   characteristics.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/12044

* Enhancement - Add option to pause synchronization on metered connections: [#4808](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/4808)

   On platforms that support metered-connection detection, an option is now
   available to pause folder synchronization when the network connection switches
   to metered-connection. When synchronization is paused, force-syncing can still
   be done.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/4808
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11305

* Enhancement - Add option to move files to trash instead of deleting: [#9001](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9001)

   An option has been added that when files on the server are deleted, the client
   will move them to the system trash bin instead of deleting those files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9001
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11320

* Enhancement - Prevent same default sync folder for multiple accounts with Spaces: [#11204](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11204)

   This is done by tagging the sync folder by an extended attribute (Linux/macOS)
   or an alternative data stream (Windows).

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11204
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11364

* Enhancement - Use less modal dialogs: [#11304](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11304)

   As the rather high number of modal dialogs we used caused different issues on
   different platforms, we decided to use them less often and try other concepts.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11304
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11032
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11208

* Enhancement - Include recent changes in scheduled syncs: [#11347](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11347)

   When starting a new sync we now also include the recent change events in the
   discovery.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11347

* Enhancement - Improve handling of a server blocking an unsupported client: [#11424](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11424)

   We improved the handling of HTTP 403 status codes.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11424

* Enhancement - Ask user to restart application when update is available on Windows: [#11442](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11442)

   Instead of a tray message, we now display a modal dialog on Windows to inform
   the user about a downloaded update. Also, we now can prompt the user to restart
   the application and apply the update immediately, adding a bit of user comfort.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11442

* Enhancement - New Folder status: [#11491](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11491)

   We rewrote the Folder status page.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11527
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11491

* Enhancement - Pause sync when behind a captive portal: [#11533](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11533)

   When the operating system detects a captive portal, stop all outgoing network
   requests. These requests will fail with an SSL certificate mismatch error. When
   the captive portal is "gone", synchronisation will be restarted.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11533
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11567

* Enhancement - Support for prompt_values_supported in openid-configuration: [#11729](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11729)

   We implemented support for idP's to specify the supported prompt values.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11729

* Enhancement - New branding option: automatically sync new spaces: [#11751](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11751)

   A branding option was added to add new sync connections for newly discovered
   spaces.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11751
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11774

* Enhancement - Display how many spaces are un-synced: [#11760](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11760)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11760

* Bugfix - Crash when checking the sync file status: [#11981](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11981)

   Sometimes a `Folder` is created for a local path that we cannot sync (e.g. it's
   not writable). This folder will not have a sync engine. If the engine of this
   `Folder` is accessed, this will lead to a crash.

   The fix is to check for the existence of a sync engine in the
   `Folder::canSync()` method.

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix early-use crash in the folder watcher on Linux: [#11460](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11460)

   In a few error scenarios, the folder watcher on Linux shows a dialog with an
   error message. A crash has been fixed where this occurred before the GUI was
   fully initialised.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11460
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11475

* Bugfix - Client stuck in `reconnecting`: [#11467](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11467)

   Properly handle errors during the update of the server settings. Due to an
   unhandled result, the client could get stuck in a `reconnecting` state.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11467

* Bugfix - Ensure folders are scheduled only once: [#11552](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11552)

   ownCloud - Albert@owncloud.com
   ownCloud - Katherine@owncloud.org
   ownCloud - Marie@owncloud.com
   ```

   Back to

   ```

* Enhancement - Add support to provide a list of ports for the OAuth process: [#11276](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11276)

   We added a branding option that enables us to specify a list of ports that are
   used for the local server during the OAuth process.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11276

* Enhancement - Support `Active Directory Federation Service` as identity provider: [#11646](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11646)

   We changed the OAuth workflow to support `Active Directory Federation Service`

# Changelog for ownCloud Desktop Client [5.2.0] (2023-11-27)

The following sections list the changes in ownCloud Desktop Client 5.2.0 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

[5.2.0]: https://github.com/owncloud/client/compare/v5.1.2...v5.2.0

## Summary

* Bugfix - Fix URL resolution for app provider: [#11296](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11296)
* Bugfix - Fix crash on unhandled status code on rename check: [#11379](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11379)

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix URL resolution for app provider: [#11296](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11296)

   We fixed a bug in the URL resolution for the app provider. If owncloud is
   installed to a non-root directory we computed a wrong URL for the app provider
   urls. This could trigger a connection validation in the client, which intern
   triggered a request to the app provider. Resulting in an endless loop rendering
   the client unusable.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11296

* Bugfix - Fix crash on unhandled status code on rename check: [#11379](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11379)

   We fixed a bug that caused the application to crash instead of just aborting the
   current sync.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11379

# Changelog for ownCloud Desktop Client [5.1.2] (2023-11-10)

The following sections list the changes in ownCloud Desktop Client 5.1.2 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

[5.1.2]: https://github.com/owncloud/client/compare/v5.1.1...v5.1.2

## Summary

* Bugfix - Fix crash when keychain job takes longer than expected: [#11361](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11361)

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix crash when keychain job takes longer than expected: [#11361](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11361)

   In 5.1.1, we introduced a timeout for keychain jobs that killed them when their
   execution time exceeded 5 seconds and log this to allow debugging of problems
   related to secrets handling.

   Apparently, there are valid cases in which these jobs can take longer than the
   expected timeout, e.g., when the user needs to unlock their keychain first or
   configure it otherwise.

   We now let the jobs run indefinitely and log every 5 seconds whether the job is
   still running.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11361

## Summary

* Bugfix - Prevent permanent deletion of files when disabling VFS: [#11331](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11331)

## Details

* Bugfix - Prevent permanent deletion of files when disabling VFS: [#11331](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11331)

   When a user disabled the virtual files feature on Windows, all currently
   dehydrated files were deleted accidentally. On the server those files where
   still available in the trash bin. This regression was introduced in the previous
   release 5.0.0.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11331

## Details

* Bugfix - Crash when accepting a notification: [#11226](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11226)

   We fixed a potential crash when clicking on a notification.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11226

* Bugfix - Fix crash on start-up when starting shell integration: [#11280](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11280)

   A possible crash has been fixed that could occur during start-up, when the shell
   integration started doing requests before the client itself completed starting
   up.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11280
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11288

* Bugfix - Properly schedule the sync after an account was added: [#11308](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11308)

   We fixed a bug where a folder was scheduled to be synced before the account
   reported it was ready. This resulted in the sync having no effect and the folder
   was then only synced once we polled the etag.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11308

* Bugfix - Don't start credentials save jobs during shutdown: [#11313](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11313)

   Due to a bug we "re-saved" the credentials during application shutdown. As the
   application was quitting while the jobs where running we might have encountered
   corrupted credentials or crashes.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11313

* Enhancement - `--cmd` argument added to the GUI client: [#10976](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10976)

## Details

* Bugfix - Avoid duplicate notifications when selective sync is enabled: [#5682](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5682)

   We no longer show multiple messages about files which were excluded from the
   sync because they were excluded by the users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5682

* Bugfix - VFS Placeholders can now be replaced with folders: [#10223](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10223)

   If a local VFS placeholder is replaced with a folder on the server, the client
   previously failed to populate the change.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10223

* Bugfix - Authentication dialog no longer appears again and again: [#10351](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10351)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10351

* Bugfix - Possible deadlock during log setup: [#10905](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10905)

   If an error occurred during the setup of the log file, it was possible that the
   client got deadlocked.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10905

* Bugfix - Do not create default sync root when loading accounts: [#10919](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10919)

   Creating the default sync root is only needed at initial setup. If a user
   chooses to point all folders for Spaces outside that default sync root, and
   deletes the default sync root folder, it will now no longer be created.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10919
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11128

* Bugfix - Update capabilities and other info after connect: [#10978](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10978)

   We fixed a bug where server infos might have only been updated several minutes
   after the client connected to the server.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10978

* Bugfix - Account activity and crash after an account was removed: [#10990](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10990)

   We fixed a bug where an account performed actions after it was removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10990

* Bugfix - Crash during application shutdown: [#11016](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11016)

   We fixed a where the main instance was accessed after it was destroyed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11016

* Bugfix - Hide hidden folders again in the selective sync view: [#11047](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11047)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11047

* Bugfix - Fix check if a file is a placeholder: [#11107](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11107)

   Previously, files with zero bytes in size were considered placeholders. This is
   not correct, and has been fixed by using the correct API to check for
   placeholders.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11107

* Bugfix - Hydration state of file after a directory was replaced with a file: [#11162](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11162)

   If a synced directory was replaced with a file on the server, we downloaded it
   instead of replacing the folder with a VirtualFile placeholder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11162

* Bugfix - Only synchronize after the server settings where refreshed: [#11168](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11168)

   We fixed an issue where the sync was started on outdated server settings.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11168

* Bugfix - Consistently use the same icon for folders: [#11190](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11190)

   In 4.0 we introduced a new icon for sync connections. In some places however we
   continued to use the system provided icon for folders, this resulted in an
   inconsistent application look.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11190

* Bugfix - Branding of folder status overlay: [#11192](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11192)

   We fixed a bug where branded overlay icons for the display of the sync status
   where not used.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11192

* Bugfix - Creation of folder on the server: [#11232](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11232)

   We fixed an issue in the FolderSyncWizard when the user provided a path with
   multiple slashes (//folder).

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11232

* Bugfix - Selective sync when not the remote root is synced: [#11233](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11233)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11233

* Change - Extract Nautilus: [#8991](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8991)

   While the crash reporter still requires a graphical user interface to work, this
   change nevertheless simplifies reporting crashes from the commandline client a
   lot.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8991

* Change - Remove support for sidebar entries for non-vfs setups on Windows: [#10788](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10788)

   For vfs setups, this is handled by Windows itself.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10788
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10910

* Change - Remove support for client side system proxy credentials: [#10866](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10866)

   We removed the support to query and store credentials for the system proxy.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10866

* Change - Modernize systray menu: [#10939](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10939)

   We had a closer look on the system tray and cleaned it up.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10939
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10949
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10999

* Change - We removed the pre 2.9 credentials migration: [#11081](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11081)

   Migrating credentials from a 2.8 or older client is no longer possible.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11081

* Change - Remove libcloudproviders integration: [#11148](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11148)

   Since its implementation in 2019 our support our for it was 'limited'.
   Additionally, as far as we can tell it was not picked up by any major Linux
   distribution.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11148
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11157

* Change - Disable context menu item to get a public link for a space: [#11242](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11242)

   The context menu item "Create and copy public link to clipboard" didn't work
   correctly when used with Spaces: users were always redirected to the web
   frontend. This menu item is now disabled, waiting for a server-side changes.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/11242
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11079

* Enhancement - Store proxy password securely: [#261](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/261)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/261

* Enhancement - Windows VFS: Prevent rename to ignored file name: [#8216](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8216)

   We now prevent renaming of virtual files to ignored file names. This basically
   resulted in deletion on the server and a local placeholder that pointed to a
   non-existing file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8216
   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/63

* Enhancement - Change how all files deleted is handled: [#8360](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8360)

   When the client detects that all files are deleted on either side of the sync,
   the client now aborts the sync and asks for a user decision. Afterwords a new
   sync is started.

   Previously we blocked the current sync until the user responded which could lead
   to unwanted side effects.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8360

* Enhancement - Port from QtSingleApplication to KDSingleApplication: [#8432](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8432)

   Instead of relying on an old copy of QtSingleApplication we use
   https://github.com/KDAB/KDSingleApplication

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10754
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10758

* Enhancement - Enable crash reporter in commandline client: [#8991](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8991)

   While the crash reporter still requires a graphical user interface to work, this
   change nevertheless simplifies reporting crashes from the commandline client a
   lot.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8991

* Enhancement - Make "Show files versions..." context menu action available: [#10197](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10197)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10197

* Enhancement - Log http request when it is sent: [#10313](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10313)

   We now log the http request when it is sent, not when it is created. This will
   enable us to print more headers set by the platform and measure the request time
   more accurately.

* Enhancement - Allow selective sync of spaces in folder wizard: [#10596](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10596)

   When manually configuring the synchronization of spaces, we now show the
   selective sync page again to allow users to selectively disable the
   synchronization of remote directories.

   This prevents the unnecessary synchronization of files until the user can use
   the account settings dialog to configure selective sync.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10596
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11044

* Enhancement - Send a language header in all http requests: [#10619](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10619)

   All http requests to the server will now contain the language for the client.
   This can be used by the server to localize responses like error messages.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10619
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11020

* Enhancement - Help user fix problems on the last setup wizard page: [#10680](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10680)

   When there are problems within the advanced configuration on the last setup
   wizard page, we no longer just show an error message but also "un-hide" those
   settings to give the user a chance of fixing the problem.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10680
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/11029

* Enhancement - Display a progress spinner during the initial setup: [#10751](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10751)

   We now display a progress spinner after the setup wizard, until the client is
   done setting the account up.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10751

* Enhancement - Reduce how often file changes are handled: [#10825](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10825)

   We no longer handle file changes every 1s but gather them for 10s and handle
   them then.

   This should reduce the amount of unnecessary checksum computations and attempted
   syncs.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10825

* Enhancement - Persist filter settings for Not Synced tab: [#10928](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10928)

   We now store the filter settings in the Not Synced tab. So after a restart of
   the client, the filter will still be the same as the last time.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10884
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10928

* Enhancement - `--cmd` argument added to the GUI client: [#10976](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10976)

   In 4.1 we added a `--cmd` argument to the AppImage to allow users to use the
   commandline client contained in the AppImage more easily.

   The `--cmd` argument is now supported on all platforms to support consistency.

* Bugfix - Missing mtime in oCIS uploads: [#10950](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10950)

## Details

* Bugfix - Wrong davUser in cmd client: [#10946](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10946)

   We fixed a bug where the wrong dav user was used in the URL, when the username
   from the credentials differed from the username used on the server.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10946

* Bugfix - Missing mtime in oCIS uploads: [#10950](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10950)

   When uploading a file to oCIS the server ignores the X-OC-Mtime header and
   expects the mtime to be part of the Upload-Metadata header. We now provide both.

[4.1.0]: https://github.com/owncloud/client/compare/v4.0.0...v4.1.0

## Summary

* Bugfix - Follow same site redirects in the Wizard: [#5743](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5743)
* Bugfix - Show systray status when a sync error occurred: [#10834](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10834)
* Bugfix - Owncloudcmd: Ensure plugin path is initialized on Linux: [#10842](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10842)

* Enhancement - Allow users to call commandline client from AppImage: [#10888](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10888)

## Details

* Bugfix - Follow same site redirects in the Wizard: [#5743](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5743)

   We fixed a bug where the client did not follow same site redirects during the
   setup. If the used URL https://test.com/owncloud redirected to https://test.com
   the new URL was not correctly used for the newly created account.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5743

* Bugfix - Show systray status when a sync error occurred: [#10834](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10834)

   The systray menu for the ownCloud icon has an entry that shows the sync status.
   However, when a sync error occurred, the entry would have no text in it. This
   has now been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10834

* Bugfix - Owncloudcmd: Ensure plugin path is initialized on Linux: [#10842](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10842)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10842

* Bugfix - Use correct username with basic auth and LDAP: [#10856](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10856)

   With basic auth the name from the login credentials might not align with the
   name on the server. We corrected the assumption and no longer change the
   username.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10856

* Enhancement - Allow users to call commandline client from AppImage: [#10888](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10888)

   When the AppImage is called with the new commandline parameter --cmd, it will
   internally dispatch the call to the contained owncloudcmd binary. Otherwise, the
   call will be forwarded to the regular owncloud GUI binary as before.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10888

* Bugfix - Don't abort local folder deletions on unrelated errors: [#9311](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9311)

   We fixed a bug where folder deletions where not performed if any sync error
   occurred anywhere in the sync tree.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9311

* Bugfix - Fix update channel dropdown: [#10251](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10251)

   When switching to the beta update channel in testpilotcloud, a warning will pop
   up. When canceled, the selection should reset. This did not work reliably in
   localized clients due to the use of string comparisons. Using a numeric index to
   keep track of the old value fixes the problem.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10609

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10254

* Bugfix - Undefined client state after fetching credentials failed: [#10408](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10408)

   We fixed a bug where the client got stuck in a "No connection configured" state
   if an error occurred during the retrieval of the credentials from the system's
   keychain. The client then required a manual log out and log in.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10408
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10505

* Bugfix - Escape navigation elements from user name: [#10427](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10427)

   We use the user name as folder name, if a user name contains path navigation
   elements we now escape them.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10427

* Bugfix - Under certain conditions the folder watcher could drop events: [#10458](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10458)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10607

* Bugfix - UI freeze when multiple modal dialogs displayed on macOS: [#10621](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10621)

   Due to incorrect handling of the dialogs, the UI could freeze.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10621

* Bugfix - Ensure the account state is properly persisted: [#10648](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10648)

   We didn't properly persist the login/logout state.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10648

* Bugfix - Reconnect got stuck if the server supports app providers: [#10666](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10666)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10666

* Change - Implement server guided migration to spaces: [#9945](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9945)

   We added a feature that allows limited automatic migration of existing syncs to
   oCIS spaces.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9945
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/3574

* Enhancement - Display `This space is either disabled or deleted` for gone spaces: [#9700](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9700)

   We now provide a less technical error when a space was disabled or deleted.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9700

* Enhancement - Sync virtual files that are locked by office etc: [#9829](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9829)

   We now upload locked files again when Windows virtual files are used. This was
   disabled in 2.9.0 as it caused the file metadata and the locked files to get out
   of sync. The new solution implements explicit handling of outdated placeholders.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9829

* Enhancement - Replace term (un)pause with a more suitable one: [#10231](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10231)

   We used the terms pause and unpause synchronization where the synchronization
   was actually terminated and restarted.

   Now, we use the terms stop and start synchronization, which better communicate
   the actual behavior.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10231
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10529

* Enhancement - Check for long paths when these are not enabled on Windows: [#10264](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10264)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10264
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10677
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10352
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10679

* Enhancement - Implement a possibility to Desktop.ini icon updates on Windows: [#10361](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10361)

   We implemented an option which allows to disable the automatic update of the
   folder icon for sync folders on Windows.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10361

* Enhancement - Disable DPI scaling factor rounding on Windows: [#10406](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10406)

   Qt5 By default rounds up the selected scale for values > .5 We now use the
   actual scale factor.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10406

* Enhancement - Display quota for Spaces: [#10453](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10453)

   Quota is now displayed for all folders.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10453

* Enhancement - New WebFinger workflow: [#10517](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10517)

   OwnCloud Infinite Scale servers may provide a new WebFinger service which
   clients can use to discover an actual instance they should connect to.

   This is useful when a large organization operates multiple instances to
   distribute the load on multiple servers, or single departments operate their own
   servers, but they all use a common entrypoint URL and authentication system.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10517
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10665
   https://owncloud.dev/services/webfinger/

* Enhancement - Branding: Allow the addition of buttons to open a URL: [#10518](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10518)

   We added a branding option that allows to add buttons to the toolbar. Those
   buttons will then open a hardcoded web page.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10518

* Enhancement - Build the client without the auto updater by default: [#10537](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10537)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10537

* Enhancement - Improve presentation of connection state: [#10557](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10557)

   Don't display `No connection configured` when disconnected but `Disconnected
   from:`. Introduce new state, `Connecting to`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10557

* Enhancement - Display open in web in file browser context menu, on sync roots: [#10572](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10572)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10572

* Enhancement - Display space subtitle if available: [#10577](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10577)

   If a subtitle is set on a spaced we now display it instead of the local path.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10577

* Enhancement - Open sharing options in Web: [#10590](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10590)

   When selecting "Share..." in the file browser context menu, we now not only
   display that file in the web view but also directly show the sharing options.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10590

* Enhancement - Display the space name provided by the server: [#10602](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10602)

   If a space is renamed on the server, this change is now displayed in the client.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10602

* Enhancement - Always point to the latest documentation: [#10634](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10634)

   We used a URL for the documentation that contained the client version. While
   this ensured a used would get the documentation matching to their client, this
   only worked with the last two released clients. So users of a pre-release or of
   a very old client where served a 404.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10634

* Enhancement - More user-friendly error handling in the cmd client: [#10637](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10637)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10637

* Enhancement - Don't invalidate OAuth refresh token on ConnectionRefusedError: [#10654](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10654)

   Due to legacy reasons the branding flag and its function differ.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5612

* Bugfix - Fix crash in Linux AppImage updater: [#10552](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10552)

   In between the releases 3.0.0 and 3.1.0, a dependency was updated, causing an
   ABI incompatibility with another library. We resolved this by rebuilding both
   libraries.

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix the display of the version string for released builds: [#10329](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10329)

   We removed a trailing `-` in the version string of released clients.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10329

* Bugfix - Only clear cookies if enabled in theme, clear cookies before OAuth2: [#10338](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10338)

   We fixed a bug that enabled the explicit cookie clearing required for F5 BIG-IP
   setups unconditionally. We fixed a bug where the cookie clearing was not
   performed during OAuth2.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10338

* Bugfix - Display `Add a Space` instead of `Add Folder Sync Connection` with oCIS: [#10340](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10340)

   We fixed a bug where the wrong text was displayed on the "add" button.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10340

* Bugfix - Mac: Don't inherit the environment of the installer after an update: [#10346](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10346)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10346

* Bugfix - Correctly detect timeouts during token refresh: [#10373](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10373)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10373

* Bugfix - Open in web if debug logs are turned off: [#10387](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10387)

   Due to a bug opening the browser only worked if logging was enabled.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10387

* Bugfix - We fixed building the client on non linux unix systems: [#10398](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10398)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10398

* Enhancement - Add a `Reconnect` option to the account menu, when disconnected: [#10294](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10294)

   We added a `Reconnect` button to the account menu, this allows to trigger a
   manual reconnect try. Note: The client would try to reconnect by itself at some
   point.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10294

* Enhancement - (Re)introduce "sync hidden files" parameter in owncloudcmd: [#10390](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10390)

   There used to be an option to enable the synchronization of hidden files using
   the -h parameter which collided with the --help option and subsequently was
   removed. A new --sync-hidden-files parameter was introduced to fill in the
   missing feature.

## Details

* Bugfix - Windows VFS fixed some failing downloads: [#49](https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/49)

   We fixed an api issue where some downloads in the Explorer caused infinite
   download restarts.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/49

* Bugfix - Don't trigger ignore list when files are locked on the server: [#5382](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5382)

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5382

* Bugfix - Properly resume upload with a partial local discovery: [#5382](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5382)

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5382
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10200

* Bugfix - Add request time and other missing data to .owncloudsync.log: [#7348](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7348)

   Some parameters were missing for some operations. This fix makes the log more
   complete and more useful as a result.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7348

* Bugfix - Don't display a context-menu on the root folder: [#8595](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8595)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8595

* Bugfix - Fix copy URL location for private links: [#9048](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9048)

   We fixed a bug where a placeholder was copied to the clipboard instead of the
   URL.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9048

* Bugfix - Fix status of files uploaded with TUS: [#9472](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9472)

   Setting the upload status of files uploaded with TUS failed as we were still
   using the file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9472

* Bugfix - Don't unset implicit log flush: [#9515](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9515)

   Since https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9515 we flush the log if the
   output is stdout. We fixed a bug which disabled it again.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9515

* Bugfix - The condition for the read only files menu was inverted: [#9574](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9574)

   We fixed a bug where we displayed solutions to fix issues with read only files
   for readable files and vise versa.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9574

* Bugfix - Deadlock in folder context menu in a folder selection dialog: [#9681](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9681)

   We fixed a deadlock when a user requested a context menu in a folder selection
   dialog on Windows.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9681

* Bugfix - Fix never ending sync: [#9725](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9725)

   Under certain conditions an upload could enter a state were it would never
   finish. The client would wait for that upload so only a restart of the client or
   a manual abort of the sync could resolve the issue.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9725

* Bugfix - Fix adding bookmarks on Gtk+ 3 based desktops: [#9752](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9752)

   We used to add those bookmarks in a Gtk+ 2 compatible way only. Now, bookmarks
   are added to the file belonging to Gtk+ 3, dropping support for end-of-life Gtk+
   2. The bookmarks are now shown again for all Gtk+ 3 compatible file browsers,
   including Thunar, Nautilus, Nemo, Caja, etc.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9752

* Bugfix - Stop the activity spinner when the request failed: [#9798](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9798)

   If the server did not provide the activity endpoint we always displayed a
   progress spinner.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9798

* Bugfix - Changes during upload of a file could still trigger the ignore list: [#9924](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9924)

   We fixed another issue where changes during an upload could cause the file to be
   ignored for an increasing amount of time.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9924

* Bugfix - We fixed a crash: [#10017](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10017)

   We fixed a crash that could occur after a folder reported a setup error

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10017

* Bugfix - Sync status changes are now directly displayed: [#10101](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10101)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10101

* Change - Make share-dialog preview be more resilient: [#8938](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8938)

   We no longer enforce png thumbnails. We no longer replace the file icon if the
   thumbnail is invalid.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8938
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8939

* Change - We no longer persist cookies: [#9495](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9495)

   We no longer persist cookies over multiple client sessions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9495

* Change - We removed support for ownCloud servers < 10.0: [#9578](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9578)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9578

* Change - Drop socket upload job: [#9585](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9585)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9585

* Change - Remove support for Windows 7 sidebar links: [#9618](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9618)

   We removed the support for Windows < 10 sidebar links.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9618

* Change - Rewrote TLS error handling: [#9655](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9655)

   We rewrote the way we handle TLS errors.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9655
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9643
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9667

* Change - We removed the TLS certificate button from the account page: [#9675](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9675)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9675

* Change - Add "open in web editor" feature: [#9724](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9724)

   We now provide the option to open files in an online office suite from the local
   file browser context menu, provided the server offers integration with one of
   the supported services.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9724

* Change - Don't display error state when server is unreachable: [#9790](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9790)

   We no longer display a network error if the server is currently unavailable.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9790

* Change - Windows: Update the folder icon on every start: [#10184](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10184)

   The ownCloud installation path might have changed, causing the desktop.ini to
   point at the wrong path. We now update the icon location on every application
   start.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10184

* Change - Don't guess remote folder in owncloudcmd: [#10193](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10193)

   The commandline client was modified to explicitly accept remote folder, the
   remote folder must no longer be encoded in the server URL.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10193

* Change - When connected to oCIS, open the browser instead of the sharing dialog: [#10206](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10206)

   When connected to oCIS, we now open the browser and navigate to the file the
   user wanted to share instead of opening the legacy sharing dialog.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10206

* Change - Owncloudcmd oCIS support: [#10239](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10239)

   When using oCIS and spaces with the cmd client the additional parameter
   `--server` is required. `--server` specifies the URL to the server, while the
   positional parameter 'server_url' specifies the WebDAV URL.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10239

* Enhancement - Display `Show ownCloud` instead of `Settings` in systray: [#8234](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8234)

   We changed the menu entry to align its name with is function.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8234

* Enhancement - Built-in AppImage self-updater: [#8923](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8923)

   In release 2.10, we introduced a preview on our future AppImage packaging for
   Linux distributions. Now, these AppImages can self-update using a built-in
   `libappimageupdate` based updater and ownCloud's update infrastructure.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8923
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9376

* Enhancement - Don't query private links if disabled on the server: [#8998](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8998)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8998
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9840
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9964

* Enhancement - Add CMakeOption WITH_AUTO_UPDATER: [#9082](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9082)

   WITH_AUTO_UPDATER allows to build the client without the auto updater.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9082

* Enhancement - Support for oCIS Spaces: [#9154](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9154)

   We added support to sync oCIS Spaces.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9154
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9575/

* Enhancement - Rewrite wizard from scratch: [#9249](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9249)

   We completely rewrote the wizard from scratch. The new wizard provides greater
   flexibility and makes adding new features easier in the future. It has also been
   redesigned to improve the user experience.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9249
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9482
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9563

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9720
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9746

* Enhancement - Remove use of legacy DAV endpoint: [#9538](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9538)

   We no longer guess the DAV endpoint depending on the chunking-ng feature.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9538

* Enhancement - Set Windows VFS placeholders readonly if needed: [#9598](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9598)

   We now properly set the read only flag on Windows virtual files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9598
   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/issues/24

* Enhancement - Create continuous log files: [#9731](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9731)

   Previously, when logging was enabled, we started a new log file for every sync.
   This worked quite well if you sync a single account and a single folder. With
   spaces however we have a multitude of sync folders, which resulted in hundreds
   of tiny log files.

   Now, as soon as a log file's size exceeds 100 MiB, a new log file is started,
   and the old one is moved and compressed. The option to delete log files older
   than 4h was replaced by an option to keep a number of log files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9731

* Enhancement - Display a correct error when the wrong user was authenticated: [#9772](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9772)

   When the wrong user was authenticated using OAuth we used to display a
   misleading message. We now also style the html response the client provides to
   the file browser.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9772
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9813

* Enhancement - We improved the performance for local filesystem actions: [#9910](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9910)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9910

* Enhancement - We improved the performance of db access: [#9918](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9918)

   We removed a check for the existence of the db that was executed before every
   access to the db.

   The check was introduced in #6049 to prevent crashes if the db does not exist or
   is removed during runtime. We nowadays gracefully handle missing dbs on startup,
   removing the db at runtime is too much of a corner case to sacrifice that much
   performance, however.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9918

* Enhancement - Reduce CPU load during discovery: [#9919](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9919)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9919

* Enhancement - Remove app name from connection error message: [#9923](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9923)

   We removed the app name from some connection messages. `No connection to
   ownCloud at http://..` was misleading as the server could have any other
   branding.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9923

* Enhancement - Allow HTTP/1.1 pipelining: [#9930](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9930/)

   Under certain conditions, this change can result in a better network
   utilization.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9930/

* Enhancement - Improve look and feel of many dialogs on macOS: [#9995](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9995)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9995

* Enhancement - Windows VFS download speed improvement: [#10031](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10031)

   We improved the performance of downloads performed on virtual files in the
   Windows Explorer.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/10031

* Enhancement - Add a `prefer: minimal` header to PROPFIND: [#10104](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10104)

   This will not return missing attribs in the reply in a 404 not found status
   propset. That reduces the amount of transferred data significant.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10104

* Enhancement - Allow creation of sync roots with long paths: [#10135](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10135/)

   Until now, we were only able to create a .sync_journal.db in a path with less
   than 260 characters.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/10135/

## Details

* Bugfix - Windows VFS: Keep file attributes and pin state: [#34](https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/34)

   When a user selected "Always keep on this device" on a cloud only file, we lost
   that information. "Always keep on this device" only worked on already present
   files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/34

* Bugfix - Compare usernames case-insensitive: [#5174](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5174)

   We fixed a bug where the user name was compared with the name provided by the
   server in a case-sensitive way.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5174

* Bugfix - Use UTF-8 for .owncloudsync.log: [#9571](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9571)

   We fixed a bug where Unicode file names were not correctly displayed in
   .owncloudsync.log.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9571

* Bugfix - Crash when interacting with a folder in an error state: [#9600](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9600)

   We fixed a crash when using the context menu on a folder that encountered an
   error and was not using virtual files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9600

* Bugfix - Database was recreated after its removal: [#9791](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9791)

   We fixed a bug where the database was recreated during the removal of a sync
   folder connection.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9791

* Bugfix - We fixed a potential crash: [#9864](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9864)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9864

* Bugfix - Windows VFS: Files in an existing folder are dehydrated: [#9966](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9966)

   We fixed a bug, when a user selects an existing folder as sync root we
   previously dehydrated all existing files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9966

* Bugfix - Run next scheduled sync after a folder was removed: [#9969](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9969)

   We fixed a bug where we did not start another sync when a folder that was
   currently syncing was removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9969

* Enhancement - Throttle the UI updates during sync: [#9832](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9832)

   We reduced the number of UI updates during the sync, especially with Windows vfs
   files this should improve the performance by a lot.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9832
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9863

* Enhancement - Run vfs downloads with a high priority: [#9836](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9836)

   This should reduce the probability for timeouts when downloading vfs files in
   the Windows explorer.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9832
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9836

* Enhancement - Don't abort sync if a user requests a file: [#9956](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9956)

   Previously we aborted any running sync if a user requested a file that was not
   yet available locally. This was done to ensure the user does not need to wait
   for the current sync to finish. However, in today's code both actions the
   download and the sync can run in parallel.

## Details

* Bugfix - Fix potential download failure for renamed file with Windows VFS: [#18](https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/18)

   When a dehydrated file is renamed and immediately opened, the subsequent
   download might try to create a file with the original (un-renamed) name.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/18

* Bugfix - Possible crash when downloading a virtual file on Windows: [#21](https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/21)

   We fixed a bug that might have caused crashes when working with virtual files on
   Windows.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/21

* Bugfix - Don't publish upload if we can't finish the transaction in the client: [#5052](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5052)

   When a file gets locked during an upload we aborted after the upload finished on
   the server. Resulting in a divergence of the local and remote state which could
   lead to conflicts.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/5052

* Bugfix - Do not strip trailing whitespace from a file or folder name: [#9030](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9030)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9030
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9452

* Bugfix - Remove outdated translations: [#9105](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9105)

   Due to a bug we were not removing the translations that fell below a required
   quality margin, we only stopped updating them. Resulting in even worse
   translations in some cases.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9105

* Bugfix - Progress reporting for TUS uploads: [#9121](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9121)

   We fixed a bug with missing progress reporting in TUS uploads

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9121

* Bugfix - Fix crash if a database error occurs: [#9147](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9147)

   We no longer crash if a database error occurs on startup, instead the folder
   will enter an error sate similar to the case that the folder does not exist.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9147

* Bugfix - --version showed incorrect information about VFS support: [#9155](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9155)

   --version used to always show "Off", even when a VFS plugin was available. This
   has been fixed now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9155
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9457

* Bugfix - Client warns about non-existing files: [#9236](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9236)

   We fixed a bug where the client warns about ignored files that where added to
   the DB in previous versions of the client and do no longer exist.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9236

* Bugfix - Mention source file in activity tab when renaming: [#9238](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9238)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9238
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9453

* Bugfix - Fix crash on remove account: [#9367](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9367)

   We fixed a potential reference to a deleted item, when an account was removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9367

* Bugfix - Raise ssl issue dialog above the wizard: [#9375](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9375)

   Under certain conditions it was possible that the ssl dialog was hidden behind
   the wizard.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9375

* Bugfix - Fallback to ownCloud sidebar icons on Mac if none provided in branding: [#9381](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9381)

   If a customer does not provide sidebar icons we use the ownCloud sidebar icons.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9381

* Bugfix - Immediately retry upload if file changed during sync: [#9382](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9382)

   If a file changed during discovery and the actual upload for multiple retries in
   a row, changes of it were ignored for a period of time.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9382

* Bugfix - Don't reset change time on upload: [#9383](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9383)

   We fixed a bug where we reset the change time of Windows placeholder files to
   the value in the database during uploads. This cold cause other applications to
   detect non-existing changes in that file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9383
   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/16

* Bugfix - Fix toggling launch-on-login for macOS: [#9387](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9387)

   This would fail when upgrading the application, and the upgraded version has one
   or more letters in the name changed from/to upper-case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9387
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9433

* Bugfix - Fix translated icon names in desktop file with ownBrander themes: [#9390](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9390)

   Fixes broken translated icon reference in desktop entries for some branded build
   themes.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9390

* Bugfix - Add open local/remote folder options: [#9405](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9405)

   Add the "open local/remote folder" context menu items for non-sync-root items
   back into the accounts tab in the settings dialog.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9405
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9420

* Bugfix - Fix possible crash: [#9417](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9417)

   We change the initialisation of a Windows icon to prevent a possible crash.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9417

* Bugfix - Improve filter pop-up menu and button: [#9425](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9425)

   - replaced "No filter" option text with "All", to avoid the "No filter is not
   enabled" situation - replace the "Filter" label on the button with "1 Filter"/"2
   Filters" when a filter is active, so a user can immediately see that without
   having to open the filter pop-up

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9425
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9513

* Bugfix - Ensure proper setup of network jobs on retries: [#9437](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9437)

   On retries network jobs where not properly setup which could lead to undefined
   behaviour.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9437

* Bugfix - Fix Account Filter for Server Activity tab: [#9481](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9481)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9481

* Bugfix - If required clear cookies in more scenarios: [#9489](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9489)

   BigIp F5 requires special cookie handling on our side. We only explicitly
   cleared the cookies when we hit an unexpected redirect, now we will clear them
   also when refreshing our OAuth token.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9489

* Bugfix - Possible crash when removing non-existing folder: [#9533](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9533)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9533

* Bugfix - Can't stop basic auth login: [#9545](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9545)

   We fixed a bug where the user was asked for their credentials again and again
   with no chance to abort.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9545

* Enhancement - Retry token refresh multiple times before logout: [#9245](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9245)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9245
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9380

* Enhancement - Don't log error when checking removed file for changes: [#9304](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9304)

   We removed some misleading error messages from the log.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9304

* Enhancement - Leave password field in share dialog enabled on errors: [#9336](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9336)

   The password line edit used to be disabled because the related checkbox was
   unchecked upon errors such as failing to satisfy the requirements imposed by the
   "password policy" server app.

   Now, the checkbox will not be unchecked, leaving the line edit enabled and
   keeping the focus on it. This allows users to enter a new password and try again
   without having to enable the checkbox and clicking into the line edit again.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9336
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9508

* Enhancement - Provide informal German translations: [#9460](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9460)

   The community was maintaining an informal German translation for years but we
   were only able to provide a single version of German in the client. We now ship
   both versions, the informal can be selected in the combobox in the advanced
   settings. To be able to distinguish between formal and informal locales, we also
   include the locale identifier in the dropdown (e.g., "Deutsch (de-informal)").

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9460
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9502

* Enhancement - Always flush log when logging to stdout: [#9515](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9515)

   We improved the behaviour of logging to a terminal.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9515

* Enhancement - Retry update after 10 minutes: [#9522](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9522)

   When an update (check) fails, it is currently retried only when the regular
   timeout (10 hours by default) is triggered. With this change, we retry the
   update (check) after 10 minutes already.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9522
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9525

* Enhancement - Added branding parameter to disallow duplicated folder sync pairs: [#9523](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9523)

   We added a branding parameter to disallow the addition of duplicated folder sync
   pairs in the add folder wizard.

* Bugfix - We fixed a possible crash: [#13](https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/13)

   We fixed a possible crash that could happen during the initialisation of the vfs
   plugin.

* Bugfix - Do not ask for credentials at start-up when the user logged out: [#8924](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8924)

   When a user would log out, and quit the client, then on the next start the

   fact that the user logged out before in the account settings.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8924

* Bugfix - Immediately propagate changes to the ignore list: [#8975](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8975)

   be applied.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8975
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9149

* Bugfix - Fix icon name in desktop file with ownBrander themes: [#8992](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8992)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8992
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9150

* Bugfix - A folder moved on the server was displayed as outdated: [#9071](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9071)

   We fixed a bug where a folder moved on the server was displayed as outdated.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9071

* Bugfix - Do not sync when `unsyncedfolders` file cannot be read: [#9165](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9165)

   Owncloudcmd now checks if the file specified by --unsyncedfolders exists and can
   be read, before starting the sync. If it does not exist, show an error message
   and quit immediately.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9165
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9241

* Bugfix - Crash when handling locked files: [#9170](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9170)

   We fixed a crash that could occur when trying to add a locked folder to the
   database.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9170

* Bugfix - Don't abort upload if chunk is locked: [#9194](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9194)

   Since 2.9 we know that we need exclusive file access to a file to properly
   handle it with Windows virtual files. Therefore, we checked for the locked state
   before we start the upload. Due to a bug we checked that for each file chunk,
   now we only check when the upload starts and when it finished completely.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9194
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9264
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9296

* Bugfix - Always restart OAuth2 on error: [#9196](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9196)

   We now always restart the OAuth2 process once we got a result. This will ensure
   that a second try after an error occurred can succeed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9196

* Bugfix - Display correct error message for files containing `\:?*"<>|`: [#9223](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9223/)

   While the error message was supposed to be: `File names containing the character
   '%1' are not supported on this file system.`

   We displayed: `The file name is a reserved name on this file system.`

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9223/

* Bugfix - Fix failing dehydration causing files to be moved to trash: [#9257](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9257)

   If files where dehydrated by the user the action could fail under certain
   conditions which caused a deletion of the file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9257
   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/9

* Bugfix - Do not show Activity tab if server app is disabled or uninstalled: [#9260](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9260)

   The Activity app API nowadays returns error responses in case the app is
   disabled or uninstalled. This new behavior is now supported in the client.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9260
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9266

* Bugfix - Handle file locks for delete jobs: [#9293](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9293)

   We no longer report an error when the client tries to delete a locked file but
   wait for the lock to be removed.

   This only works when a file is deleted not on folders.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9293
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9295

* Bugfix - Run a full local discovery after we were paused or on a forced sync: [#9341](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9341)

   Previously we did an incremental search which might have skipped some local
   changes.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9341

* Bugfix - Infinite sync loop if folder is locked: [#9342](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9342)

   We fixed a bug that caused an infinite sync loop if an error occurred.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9342
   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/14

* Enhancement - Add the syncroot to the search indexed with Windows VFS: [#12](https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/12)

   Microsoft recommends adding the syncroot to search indexer to improve the
   performance with the file status icons.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client-desktop-vfs-win/pull/12

* Enhancement - Reintroduce issue filtering: [#9000](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9000)

   We reintroduced a filtering option to the issue table. With the addition of a
   Filter button we also made the existing filter by account feature more
   accessible.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9000
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9023

* Enhancement - Allow to remove broken sync folders: [#9099](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9099)

   In case a folder is no longer available it was not possible to remove the
   folder. We now made the remove action available in that case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9099

* Enhancement - Also ignore local repeating errors for a period of time: [#9208](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9208)

   If an error occurs on the server (a URL is not reachable) we try a couple of
   times, then we ignore that file for a period of time. We now do the same with
   errors that occur locally.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9208
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9133

* Enhancement - Remove the availability menu from the ui: [#9291](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9291)

   The availability options should be handled on a folder base and in the file
   browser.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9291

* Enhancement - Branding option to disable warning for multiple sync_journal.db's: [#9216](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9216)

## Details

* Bugfix - Properly handle Windows log off: [#8979](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8979)

   We now ensure that we receive the window messages dispatched by the system.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8979
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9142
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9220
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9227

* Bugfix - Disable vfs option is ignored: [#9159](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9159)

   We fixed a branding issue where vfs was used even when the parameter was not
   enabled.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9159
   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4820

* Bugfix - The client no longer idles after a minor URL change: [#9202](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9202)

   When the client detects a change of the URL we ask the user to accept the change
   or if it was only representational change (demo.com vs demo.com/) we directly
   accept the change. Due to a bug we aborted the sync only after we updated the
   URL. This caused the client to idle for one minute.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9202

* Bugfix - Config migration on systems with a 2.4 and a 2.8 config: [#9224](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9224)

   We fixed a bug where the client migrated the old settings from 2.4 to 2.9
   instead of the 2.8 settings. Only branded clients where affected by the issue.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9224
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9226

* Enhancement - Add branding option to disable icons in the file explorer: [#9167](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9167)

   We implemented a branding parameter to disable the display of icons in the file
   explorer context menu, this only affects Windows and Linux.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9167

* Enhancement - Branding option to disable warning for multiple sync_journal.db's: [#9216](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9216)

   We added a branding option that disables the `Multiple accounts are sharing the
   folder` warning. In previous client versions a bug caused the creation of new
   sync journals, causing false positives in the detection. While this can be
   handled by the individual user, companies with multiple hundreds of users may
   opt to disable the warning.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9216

## Details

* Bugfix - Mac multiple dialogs block all input: [#8421](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8421)

   We back ported a fix to a Qt bug which causes multiple dialogs on Mac to block
   all input.

   https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-91059
   https://invent.kde.org/packaging/craft-blueprints-kde/-/commit/feca22a30f8d3a2122fd9b2097351fcb2da28543

* Bugfix - Enforce rtl layout with rtl languages: [#8806](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8806)

   We fixed a bug where setting the language to a right to left language on Mac did
   not change the layout of the application.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8806
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8981

* Bugfix - Broken URL in branded builds: [#8920](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8920)

   We fixed a string issue with branded builds resulting in invalid urls.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8920

* Bugfix - Handle use of directory of another Windows VFS sync client: [#8994](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8994)

   We now better handle setup issues during the initialisation of virtual files
   support. Especially the case that a user tries to use a directory managed by a
   competitor which until now caused a crash.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8994

* Bugfix - Building libcloudprovider support fails: [#8996](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8996)

   We fixed the libcloudprovider integration.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8996

* Bugfix - Tables now display local time: [#9006](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9006)

   We fixed a bug where the sync tables where displaying utc time for some items.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9006

* Bugfix - We fixed a crash when using the retry action on an issue: [#9013](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9013)

   Using the context menu action on a sync issue could cause a crash.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9013
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9012

* Bugfix - Fix crash when closing the client: [#9014](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9014)

   We fixed a crash where we crash when we closed the client during a sync.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9014

* Bugfix - Crash on missing or unreadable sync root: [#9016](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9016)

   We fixed an issue where the client crashed after a user deleted the sync root or
   lost access to the directory.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9016
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9017
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9065

* Bugfix - A upgrade to 2.9 causes the usage of a new journal file: [#9019](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9019)

   We fixed a bug where the name of the sync journal was not properly saved to the
   settings. This caused a bug when migration to 2.9, so a new sync journal was
   created.

   This not only caused the loss of some selective sync settings, but also caused
   the display of the following warning message:

   ```
   Multiple accounts are sharing the folder.
   This configuration is know to lead to dataloss and is no longer supported.
   Please consider removing this folder from the account and adding it again.
   ```

   We also removed the account info infix from the sync db used with the cmd
   client.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9028
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9046
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/9054

* Bugfix - Properly deployment of Qt translations Mac and Window: [#9022](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9022)

   We fixed a deployment bug which prevented the translation of some components to
   be loaded.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9022
   https://invent.kde.org/packaging/craft/-/commit/77c114917826480f294d0432f147c9e9f7d19e21

* Bugfix - The file status of suffix placeholders was displayed incorrectly: [#9026](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9026)

   We incorrectly reported that suffix files where ignored.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9026

* Bugfix - When a folder is removed we leave a database behind: [#9057](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9057)

   We fixed a bug where we left an empty `sync_journal.db` behind, when we removed
   a folder/account. As we use the presence of `sync_journal.db` to determine
   whether the folder is used by a sync client this prevented using an old folder
   in a new setup.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9057

* Bugfix - Dehydrating placeholders failed if the file is read only: [#9093](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9093)

   We fixed a bug where dehydrating a read only file failed without any apparent
   reason.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/9093
   https://gitea.owncloud.services/client/client-plugin-vfs-win/pulls/33

   We now display the error type in the not synced protocol and allow to sort by
   the error type.

## Details

* Bugfix - Settings migration from v2.4: [#4597](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4597)

   We fixed the migration of settings of version 2.4 to the current location.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4597

* Bugfix - VFS support for folders in the drive root: [#4639](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4639)

   We fixed a bug where it was not possible to use a folder in C:\ as sync folder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4639

* Bugfix - Keep share link names in sync with server: [#7549](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7549)

   When the name of a share link is changed, e.g., to an empty string, the server
   may not apply this, but assign a fallback value (e.g., the link ID). The client
   therefore needs to re-check the name after sending a change request.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7549
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8546

* Bugfix - SQLite wal file grows to several gigabyte: [#7646](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7646)

   We fixed a bug where the SQLite wal file grew until the client was quit.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7646

* Bugfix - Fix missing permission for newly created folder: [#8076](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8076)

   We fixed a bug where a newly created folder had no permissions set.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8076

* Bugfix - Don't recommend non default sync option: [#8317](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8317)

   We fixed a bug where sync all was still recommended on Windows

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8317

* Bugfix - Limit min window size to 2/3 available: [#8366](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8366)

   When scaling was used the window could become bigger than the screen. The size
   is now limited to 2/3 of the screen.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8366

* Bugfix - Set up default locale correctly: [#8367](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8367)

* Bugfix - Relaunching the client on macOS will show the settings dialog: [#8377](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8377)

   Relaunching the ownCloud client when it is already running, would seemingly do
   nothing at all. To make this more consistent with other macOS applications,
   relaunching will now open the settings dialog.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8377
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8812

* Bugfix - Only show the settings if they are explicitly requested on start: [#8590](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8590)

   We now only display the settings when the user requested it on start and not
   every time the application is started a second time.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8590

* Bugfix - Ignore consecutive errors for a period of time: [#8672](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8672)

   We fixed a bug where certain errors caused a sync run every 30 seconds

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8672

* Bugfix - Properly print the sync events in .owncloudsync.log: [#8729](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8729)

   We fixed a bug in the .owncloudsync.log logger which caused enum values to be
   printed as a number rather than a string.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8729

* Bugfix - Correctly handle file path comparison on Windows: [#8732](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8732)

   We fixed a bug in which a change in the casing og the sync root made the client
   ignore changes in it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8732

* Bugfix - Locked files are not correctly synced: [#8761](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8761)

   We fixed an issue where files locked by office etc., where not correctly synced,
   when Windows Virtual files are enabled.

   We now prompt the user, previously the cmd client got stuck.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8804

* Bugfix - Fix config migrations from versions 2.8 to 2.9: [#8824](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8824)

   Due to a value change of an internal Qt configuration variable, the
   configuration data could not be migrated on many systems. We fixed this by
   implementing an additional migration path.

   Furthermore, we removed the dependency on said value within the GUI, and use the
   values explicitly from the theme to display the correct values on UI elements
   such as buttons.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8824
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8860

* Bugfix - Always exclude .owncloud files: [#8836](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8836)

   Our Linux virtual files implementation is using the file name extension
   .owncloud those files where only ignored if the Linux VFS was enabled. Under
   some circumstances it could lead to undefined client states. We now always
   ignore those files as system reserved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8836

* Bugfix - Don't crash if a certain move is undone: [#8837](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8837)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8837
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8863
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8958

* Bugfix - Prevent sync root sharing: [#8849](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8849)

   Due to legacy reasons it is possible to let two sync connections use the same
   directory. In combination with virtual files this was leading to data-loss,
   however.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8849
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8512

* Bugfix - Removed support for client side certificates: [#8864](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8864)

   Client side certificates where never officially supported and where untested in
   many scenarios.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8864

* Bugfix - The `Re-open Browser` now always does what it says: [#8866](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8866)

   Under certain conditions the previous authentication run might have failed and
   the button became unresponsive, we now start a new authentication in that case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8866

* Bugfix - Start OAuth/password prompt if password is wrong during start up: [#8901](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8901)

   If the OAuth token was invalid during start up we didn't start the OAuth process
   and the user needed to manually log out in order to log in again.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8901

* Bugfix - Handle timeouts occurring during OAuth: [#8940](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8940)

   We now handle timeouts occurring during OAuth.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8940

* Change - Don't ask the user to switch to http: [#8231](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8231)

   We no longer recommend to use a http connection if a https URL was not found.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8231

* Change - We no longer try to locate an ownCloud install at /owncloud: [#8273](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8273)

   We no longer try to locate an ownCloud install in /owncloud if we failed to
   connect to a server.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8273

* Change - Remove support for http redirects: [#8293](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8293)

   We no longer follow redirects, when a redirect is detected we will start a
   connection validation process that does follow redirects. This change improves
   the support of APM solutions which apply special redirects to provide cookie
   sessions to the client.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8293
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8253

* Change - Ignore the desktop.ini file in every directory, not only in top dir: [#8298](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8298)

   The Windows explorer files called desktop.ini were ignored only in the top sync
   dir so far. They are now ignored in the sync in all directory levels of the file
   tree.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8298
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8299

* Change - Add support for dynamic client registration with OIDC: [#8350](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8350/)

   We implemented support for dynamic client registration with an OpenID Connect
   provider.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8350/

* Change - Include full os version in the about-dialog: [#8374](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8374)

   We now include the os version in the about-dialog, this might help us to faster
   pin down os related issues.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8374

* Change - We removed the support for async jobs using OC-JobStatus-Location: [#8398](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8398)

   We removed the support of async polling jobs after discovering potential issues.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8398

* Change - Add a branding option to skip the advanced setup page: [#8665](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8665)

   If the option is enabled we will create a sync with the default values.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8665

* Enhancement - Make crash report IDs easy to copy: [#25](https://github.com/dschmidt/libcrashreporter-qt/pull/25)

   Users can now click on crash report IDs to copy them to their personal
   clipboard. This way, they can easily reference them in bug reports.

   https://github.com/dschmidt/libcrashreporter-qt/pull/25
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8540

* Enhancement - Prefer 127.0.0.1 as OAuth redirect URL: [#4542](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4542)

   When using OpenID Connect we now always use http://127.0.0.1 as redirect URL
   instead of http://localhost, following the recommendations in RFC 8252
   (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252). For OAuth2 we added a branding parameter
   which allows to specify http://127.0.0.1 instead of http://localhost.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/4542

* Enhancement - Display an icon in the Windows explorer context menu: [#4627](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/4627)

   We now display the ownCloud icon in the context menu.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/4627

* Enhancement - Show last sync date in tray menu: [#5644](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/5644)

   Users can see what "Up to date" refers to explicitly now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/5644
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8547

* Enhancement - Consider a remote poll interval coming with the server capabilities: [#5947](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/5947)

   This way, admins can configure the remote sync poll interval of clients through
   the capabilities settings of the server. Note that the setting in the server
   capabilities needs to be done in milliseconds. Default is 30 seconds.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/5947
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8780

   socket api. We show the client icon in the dolphin file browser context menu.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8464

* Enhancement - Add language picker to general settings: [#8466](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8466)

   Users can override the automatically chosen language by selecting a custom
   language in a dropdown in the general settings. Furthermore, a --language CLI
   parameter was added that serves the same purpose.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8466
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8493

* Enhancement - Attach the last 20 log lines to a crash report: [#8467](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8467)

   We now save the last 20 lines of log to a temporary file. This file is then part
   of a crash report.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8467
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8469

* Enhancement - Mention the local file name when a file name clash occurs: [#8609](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8609)

   We now display the name of the file we detected the clash with.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8609
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8630

* Enhancement - Improved handling of errors during local file updates: [#8787](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8787)

   If a local metadata update fails we now provide the proper error in the ui. In
   case that the error was caused by a locked file we now retry the operation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8787

* Enhancement - Retry sync on `502 Bad Gateway`: [#8811](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8811)

   We now treat a `502 Bad Gateway` as a less severe error and directly initialise
   a retry.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8811

* Enhancement - Display the information state in case we encountered ignored errors: [#8858](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8858)

   If syncing a file fails multiple times we mark it as ignored to skip it for a
   certain amount of time. If we have ignored files we are not in sync, we now
   don't display the green icon.

   Additionally, this change aligns the icon displayed in the system tray with the
   icon displayed in the app.

* Change - Support for OpenID Connect: [#7509](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7509)

   The ownCloud desktop client now supports OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect 1.0 is a
   simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to
   verify the identity of the end-user based on the authentication performed by an
   authorization server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the
   end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

   OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including web-based, mobile, and
   JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated
   sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing
   participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data,
   discovery of OpenID providers, and session management, when it makes sense for
   them.

   See http://openid.net/connect/faq/ for a set of answers to frequently asked
   questions about OpenID Connect.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7509

* Change - When manually adding a folder sync connection, don't display 404 errors: [#7724](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7724)

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7748

* Change - Redesign the About dialog: [#7749](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7749)

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/3787
   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7704

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/7941

* Change - The client hides the window during the authentication process: [#7922](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7922)

   ensures that the window stays accessible.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7922

* Change - The settings ui shows a prompt for a few seconds: [#7925](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7925)

   We now hide that prompt by default and only show it if needed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7925

* Change - Reorganize Settings: [#7962](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7962)

   We rename "General" to "Settings" and move the "Network" into "Settings"

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7962

* Change - Use the checksum type specified by the server by default: [#7989](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7989)

   The default type for computation of the checksum was sha1 independent of the
   type specified by the server. Under certain conditions that caused multiple
   computations of the checksum.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/7989

* Change - Move "Choose what to sync" to sync everything settings: [#8018](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8018)

   While selective sync is a feature only available when everything is synced, the
   option had its own radio button. We now moved the button to the other sync
   everything related settings.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8018

* Change - Enable Windows Virtual files by default: [#8019](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8019)

   We replaced the different styles and colors of the icons with a new unified
   look.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8038

* Change - Sharing dialog is now always on top of the settings dialog: [#8050](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8050)

   The sharing dialog is now a sub dialog, so it will be easier to continue sharing
   a folder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8050

* Change - Remove the branding option `wizardSelectiveSyncDefaultNothing`: [#8064](https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8064)

   The branding option was removed as believe that it did not provide a good user
   experience. We recommend `newBigFolderSizeLimit` together with
   `wizardHideFolderSizeLimitCheckbox` as a replacement.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/pull/8064

* Change - Account display name `servername (username)` to `username@servername`: [#8104](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8104)

   We changed the way the accounts are displayed to improve the syntactical value.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8104

* Change - Remove update channels from the ownCloud client: [#8127](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8127)

   To ensure a maximum of stability user should not replace their productive client
   with a preview build. For that exact reason we offer testpilotcloud clients,
   they can be installed in parallel and updated via the beta channel.

   If a user is more adventurous than the average a manual installation of a
   preview is always possible.

   https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8127

* Change - Display the users avatar in the activity list: [#8169](https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/8169)

   We now display the users avatar if available in the activity log table.
