Bugfix: Make open account in browser accessible for keyboard navigation

On the account settings page, the status label contained the URL of the
server. This URL was not accessible with keyboard navigation or when a
screen-reader was used. Now there is an "Open in Web Browser" action in
the pop-up menu of the "Manage Account" button (which is next to the
status label), and the URL has been removed from the status label.
